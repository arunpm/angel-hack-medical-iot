The very new concept of internet of things is getting more attention recently.Proudly we can say our project is based on that internet of things making use of clusterpoint api .the heartbeat and movements are sensed with the help of  our hardware band that sends to the cluster cloud, where it is processed , plotted and made available to doctors any time

[ It is a hardware setup ]

1.Heartbeat sensor 
2.MSP430G2553 
3.UART to USB converter 
4.FET MSPFET430UIF programer/emulator
5.Connected Launchpad ( TM4C1294XL )
